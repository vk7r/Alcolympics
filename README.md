# Welcome to Alcolympics! 🍻🏅

To proceed, you **MUST** follow the sacred rules of the game:

1. 🎉 **Have Fun**

2. 🌳 **Branch Out When Creating New Games**

3. 🔁 **Follow Rule 1 & 2**

## How to Contribute!

main.py contains the game’s main loop, a terminal-based menu that acts as the hub.

You can build your game with any GUI or language you like, but it **MUST** be wrapped in a Python file so it can be integrated with the main loop.

Don’t forget to add any new dependencies your game needs into requirements.txt.
